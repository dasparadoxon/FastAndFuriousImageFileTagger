# Fast And Furious Image File Tagger
Windows Forms Application, that lets you quickly tag image files using their filenames to store the tags.

Focus is also on being able to use a 100% keyboard workflow for maximum comfort and speed.

You will need to install SQLITE. 

I recommend the NuGet Package from https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SQLite .
